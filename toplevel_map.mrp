Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:830 - Cannot automatically set COMPENSATION attribute for PLL_ADV
   clockpll/pll_base_inst/PLL_ADV because no input clock signal was found.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal osc_clk connected to top level port osc_clk has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network pano_button_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   SYSRST_N_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   6 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   6 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "clockpll/clkout1_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clockpll/clkout0" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "clockpll/clkout2_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clockpll/clkout1" is loadless and has been removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "osc_clk" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "osc_clk" (PAD) removed.
The signal "clockpll/clkfbout_buf" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "clockpll/clkf_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
  The signal "clockpll/clkfbout" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "clockpll/clkin1" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "clockpll/clkin1_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
Unused block "clockpll/pll_base_inst/PLL_ADV" (PLL_ADV) removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
